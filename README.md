# Welcome to our Computer Science Department Website Project!
## Project Overview
Hello there! We're on a mission to create an awesome website for our Computer Science Department. This website will be like a digital home for all things related to our department â€“ easy to use, informative, and a bit fancy too!
### What's Inside The Project?
 1. Easy Navigation:
   Find your way around easily, whether you're on a big computer or a tiny phone.
 2. School Stuff:
   Learn about our courses, what we teach, and what you can study here.

3. Events and News:
   Stay updated on all the exciting events happening in our department.

4. Student Resources:
   Find helpful things like notes, project guides, and opportunities for students.
5. Get to know our facilities

#### How You Can Help
1. If you know a bit about coding, help us make the website even better. 
2. Share your thoughts on how the website should look or even create some cool designs.
3. Help us make the website content clear and friendly.

### STEPS BY STEP APPROACH IN CLONING
1. If you don't have Git installed on your computer, download it from git-scm.com.
   
2. Create a GitHub account at github.com to access its features.

3. Tell Git who you are by running these commands in your terminal, replacing "YourName" and "your.email@example.com" with your details:
    git config --global user.name "YourName"
    git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

4. Fork the Repository:
Find the repository you want to work on on GitHub and click "Fork" in the top-right corner. This creates your copy of the project.

5. Clone to Your Machine:
Open your terminal and use git clone with the repository's URL to bring it to your computer:

6. Jump In:
Move into your project folder: cd <repository_directory>. 

7.  Create a Branch:
If you're adding a new feature or fixing something, create a branch to keep things organized: git checkout -b <branch_name>

8. Make Your Magic Happen:
Open your code editor, make the changes you want, and save.

9. Stage Your Changes:
Let Git know what you've done:
  Copy code
  git add .

10. Commit Your Work:
Capture your changes with a short, clear message:
  Copy code
  git commit -m "Your commit message here"

11. Share Your Brilliance:
If you made a new branch, share it on GitHub:
  Copy code
  git push origin <branch_name>

12. Pull Request Time:
On GitHub, you'll see a prompt to create a pull request. Click it, follow the steps, and send your changes to the original project.

Great job! You have successfully cloned a repository, personalized it, and contributed like a coding expert.
